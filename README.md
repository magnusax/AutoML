# ml-meta-wrapper
The project aims to develop a customized ML framework on top of existing libraries 

It will be written in python3.4+. Libraries which will be heavily relied upon are:

### Pre-processing
* sci-kit learn (for e.g. outlier detection and standardizing)
* scipy
* More to follow...

### Visualization
* Seaborn
* Hypertools

### Learning and evaluation
* sci-kit learn
* tensorflow/keras
* xgboost
* More to follow...

### Intepretation
* LIME

Wrapper modules will be added with time. Albeit most machine learning tasks fit on a single laptop, I will consider writing some modules in Spark (perhaps best suited for ETL jobs) or DASK/BLAZE.
